# Dotfiles

I use [GNU/stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles in this repo.

The list of programs these dotfiles are for, is below:

* alacritty
* zsh
* i3
* dunst
* nvim
* newsboat
* polybar
* rofi
* zathura

Additional dotfiles outside this repo:

* [XMonad](https://gitlab.com/dimitrissp/xmonad-configuration)
* [Emacs](https://gitlab.com/dimitrissp/emacs-configuration)

The rest can be installed by calling `stow <folder>` or just `stow *` to install everything.
