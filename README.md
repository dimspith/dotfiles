# Dotfiles

I use [GNU/stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles in this repo.

To use it, clone this repo in `~/.dotfiles` with:

```console
git clone https://gitlab.com/dimitrissp/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

The list of programs these dotfiles are for, is below:

* alacritty
* zsh
* i3
* dunst
* nvim
* newsboat
* polybar
* rofi
* zathura

They can be installed by calling `stow <folder>` or just `stow *` to install everything.
